# Dart-Playground

My very personal Google Dart playground. Nothing special, but to good as to move to /dev/null.
Just a way to archive my 'learning-by-doing' code snippets.

The projects are a mix of [official Google Dart tutorials ](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/ "official Google Dart tutorials ")sources and my personal style or way how to name something.

## Further information
* [Dart Cookbook](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/cookbook/"Dart Cookbook as html")

## What's included?
The repository includes a bunch of little projects. Each of them helps me to understand a specific part of the Dart language.

* CL_HelloWorld -- a command line 'hello world' application.
* Web_HelloWorld -- a webbased 'hello world' application which is compiled to JavaScript.
* Web_DomManipulation -- a webbased 'todo app'. It's a simplified version of the tutorial one's.
